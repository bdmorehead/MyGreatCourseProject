Project Step 8

Introduction:
hello my name is Bobby Morehead. I want to give you an update on the project I am developing for the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy Cloud Development Program at Ft. Bragg. 

Summary:
I am building a Hangman Game that will provide users with a fun experience that will help them discover new words.

Architecture:
Architecture consists of:

Western themed backgrounds for all windows.
A screen that shows the rules. 
A main menu with game settings.
A single player or two player game.
An option to play with friends.
Database with at least 500 words.
The categories would be movies, animals, bugs, TV, sports teams, countries, board games, fruits and vegetables, U.S. states, and video games.
A random mechanism to limit word repeats.

Design Interface:
Background image and a hangman’s stand.
Center of the screen would have dashed lines representing the letters that the player would try to guess. Below the word category would be three rows of letters. After selecting a letter that letter would be grayed out and unable to be used again. Each time a wrong letter is chosen a body part would be filled in on the hangman’s stand. When a correct letter was selected it would appear on the line where it filled in the word. For a two-player game each person would alternate guessing a letter and working together to figure out the word. This would be especially beneficial when cooperating with a child whose vocabulary was not that diverse. If you can figure out the word before the entire body was built you win. If not, you would lose. If the player wins I will animate the character to jump off the stand and run away.

Database:
The database will contain
