Introduction
Hello, my name is Bobby Morehead.

Participation in MSSA
I am currently enrolled in the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy through Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University at Ft. Bragg, NC where I am studying Cloud Application Development. This has been a great opportunity to increase my skill set and before I retire from the military. I have no experience with computer programming so its been a little overwhelming with the amount of information that is provided, I'm just trying to retain as much information as possible, but I know I am increasing my skill set everyday. When I decided that it was time to transition from the military I looked into programs that would give me the best opportunity for a lasting career and I believe that the MSSA program gives me that.

Product
what I would like to talk to you about today is the game I am developing thats called, "Please Don't Let Me Die: A Hangman Game."

Inception:
When we were asked to choose a project to create I knew I wanted to create a game. I also knew I wanted to do a casual game that  simple enough that people could play during their spare time, but engaging enough to keep them coming back. After some research I decided that the game I would like to build was a hangman style game. 

Elaboration
As a child I enjoyed playing this game with my sister and brothers, and I thought the most people would welcome the opportunity to play this game again, especially if they were able to play with someone else. I also thought it would be a great opportunity for parents to help their children increase their vocabulary skills by working together to save the hangman.

Construction
- Requirements and Analysis
Western themed backgrounds for all windows.
A screen that shows the rules. 
A main menu with game settings.
A single player or two player game.
An option to play with friends.
Database with at least 500 words.
The categories would be movies, animals, bugs, TV, sports teams, countries, board games, fruits and vegetables, U.S. states, and video games.
A random mechanism to limit word repeats.

Design Interface:
Background image and a hangman’s stand.
Center of the screen would have dashed lines representing the letters that the player would try to guess. Below the word category would be three rows of letters. After selecting a letter that letter would be grayed out and unable to be used again. Each time a wrong letter is chosen a body part would be filled in on the hangman’s stand. When a correct letter was selected it would appear on the line where it filled in the word. For a two-player game each person would alternate guessing a letter and working together to figure out the word. This would be especially beneficial when cooperating with a child whose vocabulary was not that diverse. If you can figure out the word before the entire body was built you win. If not, you would lose. If the player wins I will animate the character to jump off the stand and run away.

Testing
Testing would be conducted throughout the development phase.

Transition
Once the initial product was released, follow on updates would be sent out regularly to increase words available.

Maintenance
Maintenance would be provided by the development team as needed.
